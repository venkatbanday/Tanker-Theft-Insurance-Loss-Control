Tanker Theft &amp; Insurance Loss Control
**Insurance Claims**

Bulk tankers are dispatched daily to various institutions. However, many tankers are experiencing tilting en route due to poor road conditions. Additionally, it has come to our attention that some drivers are stealing materials during transit by tampering with seals and adjusting the load beyond the tolerance limit of 50 kg per tanker. As a result of these increasing claims, the insurance company may refuse to renew the annual contract or may raise the premium.

**Steps Taken**

We conducted a comprehensive study of the entire operation and observed that the current seals are inexpensive plastic, secured with binding wire, and can be easily tampered with. We inquired about the cost of more secure seals, which would require a special machine to break. 

We also introduced a gauge level system to check the dip levels of all compartments, which are documented on the invoice. This allows for cross-checking at the receiving end. 

After implementing these measures, although some tankers did tilt, the seals remained intact and the materials were still secured inside the compartments. A thorough investigation revealed a discrepancy in the material quantity. Upon investigating with the police, we discovered that the driver had engaged in the theft. The driver was arrested, and actions were taken to recover the loss without filing an insurance claim.

As a result of these interventions, insurance claims have decreased, and drivers can no longer tamper with the seals or engage in theft while en route.
